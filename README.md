# Module/Lab 11 - Simple Inventory App

## Overview

This project includes a simple inventory system using the API and endpoints that we worked on for Lab 10. The 
app has some cutsome styling and some rainbow letters when you hover over them for some added fun. It also includes 
some alternate gray and white coloring for each unique row to make it easier to read when there are multiple items 
in the table.

## How to Run

- Once this is complete, open the project folder and press F1 to open the top command line.
